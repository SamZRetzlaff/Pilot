The 'pilot' app is designed as a microservice for Project 1.  This application is intended for users with the role 'pilot' and allows them to do the following:
1) View their flight schedule
2) View a paticular flight in their personal flight schedule
3) Edit details of a flight
4) Delete a flight in case of need to cancel a flight
5) Close a finished flight
6) View their personal file
7) Update their personal file

All of this functionality will be implemented with;
A) React App front end
B) Express w/CRUDL operations
C) Query functions for Express CRUDL
D) A Database (and dummy database for testing)
E) CSS
F) A Dockerfile
